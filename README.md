# wsl-go

This is a quick script to set up PHP 8.1 on WSL on Windows.

## Setup script

To use the setup script, make sure you're in WSL (Ubuntu), clone the repository, `cd` into the directory and make the setup script executable:

    chmod +x ./scripts/setup.sh
    
After that, run:

    sudo ./scripts/setup.sh
